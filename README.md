## Description
This application creates a logo based off the users preferences, by asking them questions about the shape and color they want their logo to be.

## Task
My task was to create a application that asks a user questions about the letters, colors, and shape they want, that will be used to make a logo.

## Installation
1. Clone github repo.
2. Open on vscode.
3. Open terminal and type <code>npm install inquirer@8.2.4</code> then <code>npm install jest@29.6.4</code> so you get package.json, and finally type <code>npm init -y</code> so you can have correct files needed.
4. In terminal type <code>node index.js</code> and answer questions asked.
5. Copy svg file into web browser.
